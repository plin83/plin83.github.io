My name is Peng Lin (bryan). Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a Postdoc Associate at [Massachusetts Institiute of Technology (MIT)](http://www.mit.edu). I received my PhD in 2017 from [University of Massachusetts Amherst in United States](www.umass.edu) and holds a Bachelor degree from [Southeast University in China](http://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm) (Honors Class). My research focuses on [Neuromorphic Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering). In particular, we try to use emerging nanoelectronic devices such as [Memristor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor) to form a highly parallel matrix multiplication networks and implement neural networks directly in hardware, thus breaking the hardware bottleneck in artificial intelligence. I've published more than 30 peer-reviewed journal papers, 8 conference presentations and 2 US patents (one granted).
