> Welcome to my personal web hub. 

My name is Peng Lin (bryan). I am from Nanjing, China. Currently I am a Postdoc Associate at [Massachusetts Institiute of Technology (MIT)](http://www.mit.edu). I received my PhD from [University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst)](www.umass.edu) in Electrical Engingineering. My research focuses on [Neuromorphic Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering). This is an exciting research area that uses emerging nanoelectronic devices such as [Memristor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor) to form highly parallel matrix multiplication networks and operate neural networks in hardware, similarly like what happens in a brain. We hope the new system can provide the breakthroughs in speed and energy efficiency and overcome the hardware bottleneck of current artificial intelligence systems.
